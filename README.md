#**TECHFINDER**

This project was first built for the conclusion of an IOT course I have taken in high school.
It is free, light and runs under the **MIT** license.

I figured this simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript website deserved some update. Besides, I really needed some portfolio...

## New features

For this new version of TechFinder I look forward to including:

- Design update
- Responsiveness for mobile devices
- Database
    - login system
    - dynamic catalog
    - security best practices with PHP
- Admin page for user and catalog management.


As for future updates, this project is going to have its own hosting on the web.
